## 1. Overview
Shadow Adventure puts players in a **1v1 battle** where you control the ***Warrior*** character, facing off against a **mage controlled by the AI**. Both characters have **unique abilities**, which come with animations that were custom-designed. The game features complex **collision logic**, as well as **HP**, **mana**, and **aggro mechanics**, adding depth to the combat system. After defeating the mage, the player proceeds to fight the ***Skeleton King***, a monster guarding the entrance to a castle. If the player defeats the king, they win the game. Additionally, the game features a **randomly generated position on the map** where the player can collect a mana boost.

### b). Boss Fight: Skeleton King
After defeating the Mage, you face the Skeleton King, a boss character guarding the entrance to a castle.

### e). Dynamic Combat Mechanics
Combat involves managing both your character’s HP and Mana, and responding strategically to the Mage's ability and attacks and the Skeleton King's attacks.

## 3. Technologies Used
### a). Language
* **Java** : The primary language for developing the game logic, character interactions, animations, and AI.
### b). User Interface (UI)
* **Java Swing**: A simple graphical interface where the player sees their character, the enemy, health/mana bars, mana posion, ability animation, and the game environment.
### c). Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Classes**: 'Warrior', 'Mage', 'SkeletonKing', 'Player', 'Game', 'Map', etc.
* **Inheritance**: Common functionality shared between characters (e.g., base class for characters).
* **Encapsulation**: Getters and setters for character attributes such as health and mana.
* **Polymorphism**: Character abilities and actions are polymorphic, overriding common methods from base classes. e.g 'run'
